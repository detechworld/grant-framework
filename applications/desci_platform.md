## Project Overview


### Overview

- **Name:** DeTech.World
- **Brief Description:** DeTech.World is a Web3 startup focused on creating an all-in-one infrastructure for technology assets as a new asset class. Our goal is to make technology assets liquid and to facilitate the sound technology transfer and monetization processes even in early tech development phases. We do this by introducing multi-chain IP-NFTs and custom IP-NFT marketplaces to showcase unique portfolios of DAOs, research hubs, or any corporate tech R&D.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** We would like to introduce a DeSci segment within the EOS ecosystem and to be the first all-in-one platform for DeSci applications and to support numerous technology DAOs with our technology show-casing, co-creation, tech IP assessment, IP-NFTs and funding DeTech tools. We also would like to introduce custom IP NFT marketplaces to feature technology DAOs portfolios in a unique way which will strengthen the DeSci community. 
- **Reason for Interest:** Our Web3 platforms enable features that blur the line between investing and innovating, such as trust-enabled showcasing technology assets, IP protection and management, co-creation, AI based assessment, matching investors and innovations, and providing novel funding, monetization, licensing, and DeFi tools for a new class of assets: Tech Assets. Our platforms are already deployed at some European and Israeli technology transfer offices and DeSci.

## Development Status

The platform built on Graphene has been piloted and the product/market fit has been already verified. The transition from Graphene to the EOS for DeSci applications is under evaluation. We target to enable quick roll-out for technology DAOs and other DeSci communities. This is the main motivation of this application. During 5 months it's going to create MVP based on EOS framework. MVP includes basic Tech Assets Showcasing, Collaboration, Assessment functionality and Commercialization tools.

## Additional Information

### Project Motivation

DeTech.World is a DLT platform that enables liquidity of Technology Assets, from ideation to commercialization, enhances technologies commercialization process and creates a new class of assets – Synthetic Tech Assets. 

Tech assets refer to any intangible technology-based resources and technological innovations such as know-how inventions, scientific creations, proprietary algorithms, unique design, frameworks or any other kind of intellectual property (IP).

**Tech transfer challenges**

There are several potential ways to address the challenges facing technology transfer today. 

One potential solution is to develop a more comprehensive and standardized process for technology transfer, including clear guidelines and resources for innovators to help them navigate the process and find the right partners.

Another potential solution is to provide increased access to funding and investment for early-stage technology projects. This could include the development of new financing mechanisms, such as crowdfunding platforms, to help innovators secure the resources they need to develop their ideas.

Additionally, reducing barriers to entry in the technology transfer market, such as simplifying intellectual property laws and increasing education and awareness among potential partners about the value of new technologies, could help improve the technology transfer process.

Finally, improving communication and collaboration among different stakeholders in the technology transfer process, including innovators, investors, and potential partners, could help bring new technologies to market more quickly and effectively. This could involve the development of new platforms and tools to facilitate communication and collaboration among these stakeholders.

### Market Fit

In today's knowledge age, corporate assets are increasingly dominated by intangible assets. Right now, roughly 90% of assets in S&P 500 companies are intangible, a trend that will only keep growing. An intangible asset is an identifiable, non-monetary asset that lacks physical substance. 

[![Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-15-43-15.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Gm9tPYVD/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-15-43-15.png)](https://postimg.cc/87QTNF1k)

The primary characteristics of such assets is that it’s based on contractual or legal rights.

From another side, due to the valley of Innovation Death hinders many disruptive technologies to reach a commercialization phase.

In the nutshell, there are three main areas we would like to focus on:

[![Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-15-37-43.png](https://i.postimg.cc/YqGT1C89/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-15-37-43.png)](https://postimg.cc/fJsHsZGn)

### Product Idea and Goals

We guess that the reasons why the current legal and IP system are unable to make tech assets liquid are the following:
- **No Value:** the value of technology assets is not established and unknown to the market.
- **Bad Portability:** it’s a cumbersome process to transfer technology asset ownership.
- **No Ways to Exchange:** there’s no fast and secure way to trade technology assets.

On the other hand, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or cryptoassets representing proof of title to a unique digital version of an underlying asset provide a fast and secure way to exchange. In the sports and digital arts sectors, recent NFT issuances have sold out in seconds, netting their creators millions. And the idea of DeTech.World is to provide a technical solution based on NFTs as an IP metadata container with multichain compatibility and opportunity to use DeFi tools and list assets to marketplaces.

The goals of our product are the following:	
1. Enhance capability of IP showcasing using up-to-date cryptography methods.
2. Boost experts' collaboration via economics incentives and DAO mechanism.
3. Enable quick investment decisions and add value to Tech Assets by creating statistical models of assessment.
4. Provide tools for making liquid of any Tech IP.

The actors or user roles:
- **Inventor** - creator of the Technology, owner of Tech Asset;
- **Expert** - contributor to the Technology, who provides expert opinion and makes assessment of the technology;
- **Investor** - the trader of NFT or consumer of IP.
